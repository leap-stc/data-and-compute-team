This is a [LEAP Data and Computation Team](https://leap-stc.github.io/support.html#data-and-computation-team) weekly standup 🎉🎉🎉! 
This is a way to share feedback from the past cycle, set goals for the next work cycle and coordinate work with others in the group.

Each member should aim to put down 2-3 goals going into the meeting. We then try to discuss how to best align activities around the group to facilitate collaboration as much as possible. 

Expecting responses from all members of @leap-stc/data-and-compute.
